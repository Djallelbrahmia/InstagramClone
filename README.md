Title: Instagram Clone

Description:
The Instagram Clone project is a replica of the popular social media platform, Instagram. By building this project, I gained valuable hands-on experience in cloning Instagram's core features. Through this project, I successfully mastered the use of Firebase and Firestore as the backend technologies.
